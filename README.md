This repository contains a sample of classes, scripts and documents that I have written during the past few years.
Hopefully this will be useful in demonstrating the languages I am familiar with, my coding style, and the typical level of complexity of the systems I work on.
Please use the **Code** > **Download ZIP** option to download this repository, which I have arranged into subdirectories. A brief overview of each file can be found below.
