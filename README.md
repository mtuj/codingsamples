This repository contains a sample of classes, scripts and documents that I have written during the past few years.

Hopefully this will be useful in demonstrating the languages I am familiar with, my coding style, and the typical level of complexity of the systems I would normally work on.

Please use the **Code** > **Download ZIP** option to download this repository, which I have arranged into subdirectories. A brief overview of each file can be found below.

# Documentation

Project System Requirements document.docx
* A functional specification I wrote for a large-scale project covering several modules in an in-house ERP system. This was a project I also implemented and wrote the code for; if this had been distributed to other developers to work on, an additional technical specification would also been produced alongside this document.

iOS Engineer App User Guide.pdf
* A user guide I produced for an in-house iOS app that I wrote. The app is used primarily by site-based engineers for logging site visits, updating details of installed equipment, completing electronic testing documentation, and submitting time logs. I have also produced similar guides for four other in-house apps.

iOS app development summary.pdf
* A brief summary covering the in-house iOS apps I have written, including screenshots of some of the key screens.
