This repository contains a sample of classes, scripts and documents that I have written during the past few years.

Hopefully this will be useful in demonstrating the languages I am familiar with, my coding style, and the typical level of complexity of the systems I would normally work on.

Please use the **Code** > **Download ZIP** option to download this repository, which I have arranged into subdirectories. A brief overview of each file can be found below.

# Documentation

Project System Requirements document.docx
* A functional specification I wrote for a large-scale project covering several modules in an in-house ERP system. This was a project I also implemented and wrote the code for; had this been distributed to other developers to work on instead, an additional technical specification would also been produced alongside this document.

iOS Engineer App User Guide.pdf
* A user guide I produced for an in-house iOS app that I wrote. The app is used primarily by site-based engineers for logging site visits, updating details of installed equipment, completing electronic testing documentation, and submitting time logs. I have also produced similar guides for four other in-house apps.

iOS app development summary.pdf
* A brief summary covering the in-house iOS apps I have written, including screenshots of some of the key screens.

### JIRA Tasks

*A sample of the detail sections of some JIRA tasks I have written while mentoring junior developers.*

JIRA task - VIS-3180 - Core coding task.pdf
* A task I wrote for a developer to add create and update domain model objects, including ORM mappings to related database tables.

JIRA task - VIS-3435 - Code refactor (With code review feedback).pdf
* A task for a developer to refactor a collection of "building block" helper methods in a business logic class, in preparation for usage elsewhere in the system. This task was one small part of a large project, so this requirement was one element in a much wider structured system architecture plan. (Typically my role involves scoping out the full technical architecture at a high level, then breaking tasks down in manageable portions for a developer.) This task also includes some typical code review feedback I am usually required to provide back to the assignee.

JIRA task - VIS-3498 - Integration test.pdf
* A task for a developer to write an integration test to verify a specific area of functionality. For this task detail I used a standard template that includes wider guidance on test driven development in general, as well as some of the more specific system features. The developer is provided with suggested parameters for the key business logic method call, as well as expected outputs; they are expected to write the test first, then implement the logic to satisfy the requirements.

JIRA task - VIS-4056 - Integration tests.pdf
* A task for a developer to write a series of integration tests. This is for a developer who is a little more familiar with how unit testing works, so does not provide as much guidance on the basics as the previous task; however it does provide the required detail on the data and logic-specific elements of the process that is being tested.
